Ingredients:

1 head cauliflower (or other vegetable of your choice; potato, spinach leaves, onion, paneer for example)
1 cup Bengal gram flour
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
1 pinch asafetida
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon thymol seeds
salt to taste
Vegetable, canola or sunflower oil (for deep frying)


Steps to Make It:

Mix the gram flour and all the spices with a little water at a time, to make a thick batter (slightly thicker than pancake batter). Add salt to taste.


If using cauliflower cut it into bite-sized pieces. For potatoes and onions slice thin; for spinach leaves trim the stems and keep only leaves; for paneer cut into 1" cubes.

Pre-heat oil and reduce flame to medium. This will allow the bhajias to cook well both on the outside and inside.

Coat the vegetables well with batter and then deep fry till golden.

Drain on paper towels and serve with Tamarind Chutney or tomato ketchup.
